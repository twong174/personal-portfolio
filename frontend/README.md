# My Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, where I showcase my skills, projects, and background as a developer. The design is inspired by Brittany Chiang's v3 portfolio, but all the coding and styling were done by me.

## Technologies Used:

- **React**: Used for building a dynamic, component-based UI.
- **TailwindCSS**: For utility-first styling and responsive design.

## Features:

- **Background**: Information about who I am and my journey.
- **Skills**: Displays the technologies I work with.
- **Projects**: A work-in-progress section that will display detailed information about my projects.
- **Future Goals**:
  - Make project tabs more interactive.
  - Clean up and optimize the code (it could be cleaner).
  - Add links to individual projects.
